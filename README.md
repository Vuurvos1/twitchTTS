## 🎈 How to use

You can use this as a browser source inside OBS or have a browser window open.
When using this app in the browser make sure to at least click the page once so it is allowed to play audio.
You will not see any elements on the page as long as no highlighted messages are sent.

**Note**
For now, this only works with the default highlighted message reward so none of the custom ones.
You can download the project and edit the code to make it work with custom channel point rewards but takes a bit more effort to set up.

### Base url

When using the live version

`https://twitchtts.vercel.app?`

### Parameters

You can add multiple parameters to a URL by chaining them using the `&` symbol, [see example](#Example)

#### Channel

`channel=firefox__`

#### Voices

You can select a different text to speech voice by adding the voice parameter. By default, this is set to Brian.
`voice=Brian`

These are the voices you should be able to use (Note that some might not work)

```
Aditi   | Amy     | Astrid   | Bianca   | Brian     | Camila   | Carla
Carmen  | Celine  | Chantal  | Conchita | Cristiano | Dora     | Emma
Enrique | Ewa     | Filiz    | Geraint  | Giorgio   | Gwyneth  | Hans
Ines    | Ivy     | Jacek    | Jan      | Joanna    | Joey     | Justin
Karl    | Kendra  | Kimberly | Lea      | Liv       | Lotte    | Lucia
Lupe    | Mads    | Maja     | Marlene  | Mathieu   | Matthew  | Maxim
Mia     | Miguel  | Mizuki   | Naja     | Nicole    | Penelope | Raveena
Ricardo | Ruben   | Russell  | Salli    | Seoyeon   | Takumi   | Tatyana
Vicki   | Vitoria | Zeina    | Zhiyu
```

#### Text to Speech

`tts=true`

Defaults to true

#### Sub only mode

If you want to only show and or read out the highlighted messages send by subs you can do so by adding `subOnly=true` to the URL

#### Character limit

By adding the limit parameter to your URL you can prevent very long messages from beeing totaly read out.
By default this is set to null which will read out the entire message.
You can change the limit using the limit parameter like so: `limit=100`

Note that the character limit on a twitch message is 500 characters

### Example

This is an example on how your URL might look:

```
`https://twitchtts.vercel.app?channel=Firefox__&voice=Brian`
```

First, we have the base URL, then we set the channel to `Firefox__` using `channel=Firefox__` then we turn the text to speech function on using `tts=true` and last but not least we set the text to speech voice to `Brian` using the voice parameter.
